# Image Focus Field #

Version 1.0
Requirements: Media Library

## What does this extension do? ##

A new field called `Image Focus Field` is added to the section editor, where existing Media Library fields can be attached. On the entry editor, the image attached in the Media Library will be displayed within the Image Focus field and allows the person editing to click on the image and select the focal point. This position is then visualised within the 3 other smaller images located beside the main image within the Main column or underneath the main image within the Secondary column.
